PREREQUISITES

  You need git, docker and docker-compose to run the platform.
  In addition, you need cplex, which must be placed in:
  modeling-base/cplex_128.tar.gz
  To make sure all prerequisites are satisifed, run:

  ./bootstrap.sh check

INSTALLATION

  Use the installation script, which will:
    * load the modeling base docker image
    * clone git repositories for all required services
    * build docker images
    * create empty local databases
    * create a demo user
  This may take a while (expect 10-15 minutes), depending on your bandwidth and
  processing power. Run the installation script with:

  ./bootstrap.sh init

USAGE

  To run the platform, start the services with docker-compose:

    docker-compose up

  When the server is ready, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/
  To authenticate, you may login with one of 40 demo user accounts:

    Email: demo[0-39]@demo (where [0-39] is a number in the range 0 to 39)
    Password: demo

SETUP WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS

  After following the steps in INSTALLATION above on a machine with
  internet access, obtain a gzipped tarball of all images by running
  `scripts/tarball-images.sh`. Alternatively, request it from the
  Caffeine developers. Move the resulting `caffeine-images.tar.gz`
  to the server without internet access and load them with

    gunzip -c caffeine-images.tar.gz | docker load

  After loading the images, manually run lines 62-90 in `boostrap.sh`
  to populate databases and create demo accounts. Then proceed to
  the USAGE section above.
