PREREQUISITES

  You need git, docker and docker-compose to run the platform.
  In addition, you need cplex, which must be placed in:
  modeling-base/cplex_128.tar.gz
  To make sure all prerequisites are satisifed, run:

  ./bootstrap.sh check

INSTALLATION

  Use the installation script, which will:
    * load the modeling base docker image
    * clone git repositories for all required services
    * build docker images
    * create empty local databases
    * create a demo user
  This may take a while (expect 10-15 minutes), depending on your bandwidth and
  processing power. Run the installation script with:

  ./bootstrap.sh init

USAGE

  To run the platform, start the services with docker-compose:

    docker-compose up

  When the server is ready, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/
  To authenticate, you may login with the demo user:

    Email: demo@demo
    Password: demo

UPDATES

  The init script works only on a clean installation. To update the
  installation, repos and docker volumes must be deleted before re-running init.
  To do this, run:

  NOTE: This will delete all uploaded data on the platform.
  ./bootstrap.sh clean
