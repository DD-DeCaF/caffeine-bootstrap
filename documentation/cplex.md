# CPLEX Solver

Caffeine makes heavy use of the CPLEX optimizer. Without it, all mixed-integer
problems may run very slow. This mostly affects the design pipeline but also
fluxomics data.

We cannot bundle the proprietary CPLEX package, so you need to manually provide
the solver which we will integrate during installation. Please, place your
`cplex_128.tar.gz` file in the directory:

```
cplex/
```

If you are unsure about the format of that file, [please get in
touch](mailto:niso@dtu.dk?subject=Caffeine%20CPLEX%20Archive%20Format).  Learn
