Caffeine makes heavy use of the CPLEX Optimizer. Without it, certain features
may run very slow.

We cannot bundle the CPLEX package, so you need to manually provide the solver
which we will integrate during installation. Place your cplex file in:

  modeling-base/cplex_128.tar.gz

If you are unsure about the format of that file, please get in touch.
