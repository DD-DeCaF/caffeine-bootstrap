How to install the platform without internet access

1. Prerequisites

  You need git, docker, docker-compose and cplex to install and run the
  platform (see documentation/cplex for more information). To make sure all
  prerequisites are satisifed, run:

    ./scripts/check.sh

  For installation without internet, you also need gzip/gunzip.

2. Build image tarball

  Build the images and create a tarball on a machine which does have internet
  access with:

    ./scripts/save-image-tarball.sh

  This may take a while (expect 10-15 minutes), depending on your bandwidth and
  processing power. We recommend you take a look at the script to understand
  what it does.

  You should end up with a `caffeine-images.tar.gz` file.

3. Load the images

  Move the resulting `caffeine-images.tar.gz` to the server where the platform
  will run, and load them with:

    gunzip -c caffeine-images.tar.gz | docker load

  Now initialize the services with:

    ./scripts/initialize.sh

3. Running

  Start all services with docker-compose:

    docker-compose up

  You may initially see "connection refused" errors or similar while services
  are starting up. It shouldn't take more than a minute until all services are
  ready and stop showing error messages.

  When the services are ready, point your browser to: http://localhost:4200/
  Replace localhost with the address of the machine if accessing it remotely.
