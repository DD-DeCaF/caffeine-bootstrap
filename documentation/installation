How to install the platform

1. Prerequisites

  You need git, docker, docker-compose and cplex to install and run the
  platform (see documentation/cplex for more information). To make sure all
  prerequisites are satisifed, run:

    ./scripts/check.sh

2. Installation

  Run the installation script with:

    ./scripts/install.sh

  This may take a while (expect 10-15 minutes), depending on your bandwidth and
  processing power. We recommend you take a look at the script to understand
  what it does.

3. Running

  Start all services with docker-compose:

    docker-compose up

  You may initially see "connection refused" errors or similar while services
  are starting up. It shouldn't take more than a minute until all services are
  ready and stop showing error messages.

  When the services are ready, point your browser to: http://localhost:4200/
  Replace localhost with the address of the machine if accessing it remotely.
