# How to Install the Caffeine Platform

1. Prerequisites

    You need git, docker, docker-compose and ideally cplex to install and run
    the platform (see [documentation/cplex.md](cplex.md) for more information).
    As described there, please start by placing your CPLEX compressed archive
    (`cplex_128.tar.gz`) in the `cplex/` directory.

     To make sure all prerequisites are satisfied, run:

    ```
    make check
    ```

2. Installation

    Run the installation in multiple steps. Please note that you can run the
    installation in parallel using `make -j` (you may want to synchronize output
    in that case with `-O`).

    1. Create all local repositories.

        ```
        make setup
        ```
    2. Build all Docker images.

        ```
        make install
        ```

        This may take a while (expect 10-15 minutes), depending on your
        bandwidth and processing power. We recommend you take a look at the
        `Makefile` to understand what it does. Again, you can reduce the time
        needed through parallelization but you need enough memory, too.

    3. Initialize the platform. Careful, this will reset all database volumes.
        So don't run this command after using the platform for a while.

        ```
        make initialize
        ```

3. Running

    Start all services with docker-compose:

    ```
    docker-compose up --detach
    ```

    Optionally, you can look at the log output, too. It is a good place to spot
    errors.  Please, at the very least, make sure that all services are running
    with

    ```
    docker-compose ps
    ```

    You may initially see "connection refused" errors or similar while services
    are starting up. It shouldn't take more than a minute until all services are
    ready and stop showing error messages.

    When the services are ready, point your browser to:
    [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). Replace `localhost` with
    the address of the machine if accessing it remotely.
